        Mountains are elevated landforms, typically characterized by steep sides and a summit, rising significantly
        above the surrounding area. They are formed through various geological processes like tectonic forces,
        volcanism, or erosion. Mountains can be isolated or part of larger ranges, and their higher elevations lead to
        distinct, colder climates compared to lower regions. They play a crucial role in biodiversity, offering unique
        habitats and influencing weather patterns. Mountains are also valued for recreation, resource extraction, and
        their majestic scenery.
